* Study on Dynamic Discourse Against Epidemics from a Multimodal Perspective - A Case Study on the Documentary Series "China-Southeast Asia Solidarity against COVID-19" (Postgraduate Graduation Dissertation)
  * Used Praat digital technology and combined multiple research methods including a case study, a questionnaire survey, and qualitative and quantitative research.
  * Used a reference approach to explore the role of anti-epidemic dynamic discourse in the multimodal teaching of Chinese as a foreign language based on corpus analysis. 
* Review of Versailles Literature based on Conversational Implicature Theory, published in Jingu Creative Literature, ISSN 2096-8264, CN 42-1911/ I, in January 2023.
  * Explored the communication pathways of Versailles Literature through an analysis of the production of the conversational implicature theory.
  * Completed a corpus analysis using theoretical analysis methods.
  * Concluded that Versailles Literature conveyed an implication similar to ‘the quiet years, the abundance of life’, achieving the pragmatic effect of seeming demeaning by violating the principle of cooperation several times.
